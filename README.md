# CS Fundamentals

This is an open repository for me to relearn and educate myself in key Computer Science fundamentals, as I seen to have forgotten them.

# Why Java?

* It's really easy
* But it's a good middle ground, Ruby would be cheating & C would be too low just to teach fundamentals
* The JVM is really good for doing dumb things
* It gives me pointers but doesn't let me shoot myself
* Java is a pretty good **root* language.
* It's tested in coding interviews

## Data structures

* [HashtableSeparateChainingHead](HashtableSeparateChainingHead) - Hashtable implementation using linked lists with no resizing capabilities
* [HashtableSeparateChainingHeadIncremental](HashtableSeparateChainingHeadIncremental) - Hashtable implementation using linked lists with increasing size capabilities
* [ArrayList](ArrayList) - ArrayList (dynamic array) implementation with up/down sizing (linear copy)
