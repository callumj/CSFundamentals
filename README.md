# CS Fundamentals

This is an open repository for me to relearn and educate myself in key Computer Science fundamentals, as I seen to have forgotten them.

# Why Java?

* It's really easy
* But it's a good middle ground, Ruby would be cheating & C would be too low just to teach fundamentals
* The JVM is really good for doing dumb things
* It gives me pointers but doesn't let me shoot myself
* Java is a pretty good **root* language.
* It's tested in coding interviews
